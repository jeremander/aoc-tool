- Drivers
    - Haskell
        - Scaffold
        - Compile
        - Run

--------

- Upload to PyPI
- Lines of code counting
    - Lines with and without whitespace, comments
        - might need to rely on language-specific tools
    - Total characters
- Timing
    - Naive timing by wrapping calls in Python timer
    - Compile stage: naive timing OK
    - Run stage: start with naive timing
        - Eventually expose timing functions within the scaffolds themselves
    - Output function runtimes in standard format on stderr
        - Parsing
        - Solving
    - Be careful when timing Haskell due to lazy evaluation
